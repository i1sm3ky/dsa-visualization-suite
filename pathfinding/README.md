# Pathfinding & Maze Generator

The most interactive part of the **DSA Visualization Suite** — this module lets you explore pathfinding algorithms and maze generation techniques in both **grid and graph mode**.

---

## Algorithms Included

### Pathfinding

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- A\* Search
- Greedy Best-First Search
- Swarm Algorithm
- Bidirectional Swarm

### Maze Generation

- Recursive Backtracking (DFS)
- Recursive Division (Balanced, Vertical, Horizontal)
- Prim’s Algorithm

---

## Features

- Fully **interactive UI**:
  - Draw walls and weighted nodes
  - Drag start/end nodes
  - Enable **realtime mode** for live path updates
  - Toggle between **grid and graph mode**
- Customizable:
  - Speed of animations
  - Grid or graph size
  - Maze generation methods

This tool is perfect for **visual learners** and anyone curious about how pathfinding works behind the scenes.

## How It Works

This isn't just an animation — it's hands-on. You can:

- Build your own maps
- Watch algorithms find paths
- Change settings to see how the algorithm responds
- Learn by doing

---

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Zustand (for state management)
- Custom rendering and animation logic
