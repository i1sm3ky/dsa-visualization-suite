# DSA Visualization Suite

Welcome to the **DSA Visualization Suite** — a fun, interactive way to learn and explore data structures and algorithms visually. This suite includes clean, animated visualizers for **Searching**, **Sorting**, **Pathfinding**, and a minimal **Landing Page** to tie them all together.

Whether you're a beginner trying to grasp the basics or just someone who enjoys a good animation, this is built to make learning more engaging.

## Why This Exists

I built this project to:

- Help others learn DSA in a **visual, intuitive, and fun** way
- Deepen my own understanding of algorithms, UI/UX, and front-end development
- Experiment with interactive visualizations and controls

## What's Inside

| Module      | Algorithms Included                                                                 | Features & Highlights                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Searching   | Linear Search, Binary Search, Ternary Search, Jump Search, Interpolation Search     | Adjustable speed, array size, and more. Clean animations to compare algorithms visually.                                  |
| Sorting     | Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort      | Multiple controls to tweak animations, sort size, and comparison between different sorting algorithms in multiple styles. |
| Pathfinding | BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, A\*, Greedy Best-First, Swarm, Bidirectional Swarm + Maze Gen | Fully interactive: draw obstacles, drag start/end, switch between grid and graph, toggle real-time view.                  |
| Landing     | Simple, clean landing page to navigate to each section                              | Minimal, focused, and easy to use                                                                                         |

Each module is a standalone React app hosted together under one suite.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (all modules)
- **TypeScript** (Pathfinding module)
- **Zustand** (State management in Pathfinding)
- CSS for styling + lots of custom UI controls

## Try It Out

No installation needed — it’s a web app!

Just visit the [LINK](https://dsa-visualization-suite.vercel.app) and explore the modules:

- Play with array size, speed, and animations
- Compare how different algorithms behave
- Toggle between graph and grid view (Pathfinding)
- Generate mazes or draw your own obstacles

## Sub-Repos

This suite is organized into separate folders for each visualizer:

- [`/landing`](./landing) — The homepage
- [`/searching`](./searching) — Searching visualizer
- [`/sorting`](./sorting) — Sorting visualizer
- [`/pathfinding`](./pathfinding) — Pathfinding visualizer

## Final Note

This is a one-time project I created as a milestone in my learning journey.  
Feel free to fork or explore the code.

Thanks for visiting!
